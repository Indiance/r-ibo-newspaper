# What is the point of dreaming?

Growing up, I used to have grand ambitions for myself. I thought ranking first in a sixth grade
biology class meant I would eventually be good enough to become a doctor. After wrapping up
the second year of my Bachelor’s degree a couple days ago, I find myself desperately searching
the depths of my soul for the same self-belief I once had. Today is the closest I may have come
to finding it.

Dreams used to be my outlet for channeling my indomitable will to achieve big. My worldview
was rather simple as a child. I saw the world as an empty race track. As long as I followed the
road at full throttle, I thought I would eventually reach the final destination without any hiccups.
Little did this child know that the track was not actually empty. Enrolling in university made me
realize the sheer number of fierce competitors gunning for a seat in medicine. No assignment or
exam was too tough for them because they sunk hours into perfecting their craft. All of a
sudden, I realized I had to go faster than full throttle to catch up with these specimens and give
myself a chance.

This child also did not know that his car needed refilling every now and then. As semesters went
by in university, the work kept compounding like a US student’s college debt, and my anxiety
kept growing. I told myself that as long as I finished my work diligently, I will do well on my
subjects. Somewhere along the line, however, I realized I could not keep going at full throttle all
the time. After watching a bunch of unfinished lectures towards the end of the semester, I
imagine my eyes would resemble a few violently beaten egg yolks for a Gordon Ramsay
scrambled eggs recipe. My mind kept craving for a distraction away from the work until my body
eventually caved in at 4 am in the morning. I perpetually resembled a walking version of the
Windows error meme, with each part of my body popping up as an error tab every time I tried to
be productive.

Despite my best efforts, my grades were somewhat erratic. I saw my chances of getting into
medical school dwindling, like a dying flame that was once so bright it lit a fire in my soul to
pursue my dream. I asked myself what the point of dreaming was if my will was no longer strong
enough to get me to the finish line. In the midst of this questioning, I started to notice some
changes in my fourth semester. Suddenly, my speed at full throttle increased, and so did my
capacity. When I worked, I was getting more done in a shorter period of time. I was able to work
for longer periods of time without feeling incredibly exhausted. I found myself having more time
to rest and refuel my body to be ready for another day of intense work. I asked myself how this
was possible even though I struggled so much in my past few semesters.

As I was browsing the internet in search of an answer, I learnt the concept of neuroplasticity. It
refers to the ability of neuronal networks in the brain to form novel connections to grow and
adapt. Early on in my degree, I stood no chance to survive without being limited by the
constraints of a body that needed a full eight hours of sleep to survive. Now, after I had time to
calibrate to the intensity of university, I am a lot more efficient and a lot less demanding of my
body. The concept reminded me a lot of evolution by natural selection. Throughout generations,
different versions of me descending from previous versions accumulated beneficial mutations
and a newer, fitter combination of alleles to aid my survival in a world full of hungry predators.

Despite my personal growth in the last six months, I still do not fully see the point in dreaming. I
still wonder if I will ever have enough about me to land myself a seat in medical school.

However, I take solace in the fact that this dream has given me a sense of direction in my life. It
is what opened up a race track for me in the first place, which allowed me to allocate my time
and energy into something that felt purposeful. With one more year left in my degree, the finish
line is not far away. I hope to see you all on the other side of it.
